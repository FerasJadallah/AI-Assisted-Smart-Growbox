# üåø AI-Assisted Smart GrowBox

An AI-powered IoT system that automates plant monitoring and care using **Streamlit**, **ESP32**, and pre-trained AI models. The system optimizes plant health by detecting plant species and identifying early signs of plant diseases through sensor data and image classification.

## üöÄ Features

- üå°Ô∏è Monitors real-time environmental factors like **soil moisture** and **temperature** using sensors connected to an **ESP32 microcontroller**.
- üì∑ Uses **pre-trained AI models** for:
  - Plant Species Classification
  - Disease Detection
- üß† Integrates models into a **Streamlit web interface** for intuitive, real-time interaction.
- üì° Sends data between hardware and web via serial communication.
- üå± Ideal for smart agriculture, home gardening, and agricultural research.

## üß† AI Models Used

This project uses **two pre-trained models** for image classification tasks:

### 1. Plant Species Detection

- **Source:** HuggingFace Model Hub  
- **Model Page:** [foduucom/plant-leaf-detection-and-classification](https://huggingface.co/foduucom/plant-leaf-detection-and-classification)
- **Format:** `best.pt`, `yolov8n.pt`
- **Note:** This model identifies different plant species from leaf images.

### 2. Plant Disease Detection (YOLOv8)

- **Source:** Google Drive  
- **Download Link:** [Click here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wGNFhdjxl7J1rljxicbArto9Z9AJT8WA)
- **Files Included:** `.h5` and `.keras` 
- **Note:** YOLOv8 model trained to detect leaf diseases from plant images.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** These models are not included in the GitHub repository due to size limits.  
> You must download and add them manually to the project directory.
